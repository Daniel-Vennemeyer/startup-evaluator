    <h1>Hackathon Project Idea Ranking App</h1>
    <p>This application ranks hackathon and startup project ideas by analyzing their descriptions through a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. It offers relative ranking scores for submissions, a leaderboard of top ideas, and pitch refinement suggestions. The goal is to provide a valuable tool for entrepreneurs and hackathon participants to gauge the quality of their project ideas and improve them accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Motivation and Approach</h2>
    <p>The app was created to provide quick, insightful feedback on project ideas. Many hackathon participants and budding entrepreneurs lack immediate feedback on whether their ideas are compelling and feasible. This app bridges that gap, drawing from real data on both successful and unsuccessful projects.</p>

    <h2>Fine-Tuning the Model</h2>
    <h3>Dataset</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive Examples</strong>: Startups from the last four years sourced from Y Combinator (YC), representing successful projects with well-defined problems, clear value propositions, and compelling pitches.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Examples</strong>: Unsuccessful projects from RevolutionUC, the largest in-person hackathon at the University of Cincinnati, spanning the last eight years. These represent ideas that didn’t resonate as strongly with judges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By combining YC startups and less successful RevolutionUC projects, the model gained a balanced understanding of “good” versus “bad” project ideas based on real-world outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Data Augmentation and Normalization</h3>
    <p>To make the data more consistent and help the model focus on the content of ideas rather than stylistic differences, I implemented the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Normalization</strong>: GPT-4 was used to reformat and standardize project descriptions, making each idea structurally similar. This ensured that the model focused on content quality rather than language style, which prevented it from overfitting on pitch formats specific to either students or seasoned entrepreneurs.</li>
        <li><strong>Augmentation</strong>: GPT-4 was also used to generate synthetic data, primarily for creating high-quality negative examples. While creating synthetic positive examples was challenging, GPT-4 generated negative examples that sounded promising but were conceptually flawed. This helped the model distinguish substance from superficial appeal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scraping and Data Collection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>YC Startup Scraper</strong>: A scraper was used to gather data on YC startups from the past four years, capturing project names and descriptions for a dataset of compelling startup ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>RevolutionUC Submissions</strong>: As the director of RevolutionUC, I had access to historical submission data going back to 2015. This provided an authentic set of negative examples, focusing only on project descriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Application Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Ranking</strong>: Users can submit a project idea to receive a relative ranking score based on quality and feasibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboard</strong>: Displays the top-ranked project ideas based on model scoring, showcasing what makes a project stand out.</li>
        <li><strong>Pitch Refinement</strong>: Users can refine their pitch with AI-generated suggestions, allowing them to reformat their idea into a more compelling description.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>
    <p>The model is a fine-tuned version of RoBERTa for sequence classification, trained to analyze project descriptions and assign relative quality scores. It was trained on a mix of positive (YC startups) and negative (RevolutionUC) examples, with data augmentation applied for enhanced understanding.</p>

    <h3>Example Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Submit a Project</strong>: Enter a project name and description to receive a ranking.</li>
        <li><strong>Refine Your Pitch</strong>: Click “Refine My Pitch” to receive suggestions on improving the idea.</li>
        <li><strong>View Leaderboard</strong>: Navigate to the leaderboard to view the top project ideas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project provides a tool for hackathon participants, entrepreneurs, and innovators to understand what makes a project idea stand out. By combining real-world examples of success and failure with insightful feedback, it helps users refine their concepts and presents a model for evaluating project quality in a practical, scalable way.</p>
