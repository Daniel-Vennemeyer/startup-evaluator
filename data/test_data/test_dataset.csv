"Moonglow - Moonglow connects local Jupyter notebooks to remote cloud compute. Machine learning researchers and data scientists use us to scale up their experiments without having to do DevOps.

Previously, Leila was a software engineer at Jane Street. She led the build-out of its equities clearinghouse connectivity infrastructure and was the technical lead of its front-office SRE team. Trevor was part of Hazy Research Lab at Stanford, and published machine learning research at NeurIPS, ICLR and ACL.

With the explosive growth of deep learning, there are over 1 million ML researchers who do computationally intensive experiments every day. They use Jupyter notebooks to do so, but every time they want to try out a new idea, they need to get the notebooks running on cloud machines. This process, repeated hundreds of times a month, is time-consuming and error-prone.

Moonglow reliably brings the time-to-experiment down from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. Just as Vercel and Replit abstracted away the lower levels of the computing stack for web developers and programmers, we do the same for ML researchers.

"Cara - Cara is simple - it's a service that offers a drop-in solution for facial authentication. Any app or website can incorporate Cara into their service with ease - all the difficult bits are abstracted away by the robust yet secure technology hiding behind Cara's servers. The idea is to bring the power of this new technology to everyone - from aspiring startups trying to get their products off the ground to freelance developers looking for a way to differentiate themselves from the crowd. In order to prove Cara's widespread applications, we built a series of demos incorporating Cara in different aspects, proving its worth within the family, the education system, and the industry at large.

Family

Dementia and Alzheimer's are terrible to experience - both as the victim and his/her family. Though Cara can't solve major breakthroughs in medical technology, we can help mitigate the memory-related symptoms of these diseases. Cara can be used on AR devices to help patients of dementia or Alzheimer's remember who they're talking to. With the press of a button, Cara will recognize the person in front of you and pull up helpful information about them - such as their name, the last time you've seen them, and where they work. With the power of technology, we can transform the last moments of our elders into memorable experiences rather than painful ones.

Education

""Can anyone tell me who's absent today?"" - a common question repeated across the world every morning in thousands of high school classrooms, Cara can solve this too. Using a simple camera setup in front of every classroom doorway, taking attendance manually becomes a relic of the past. As students filter into the classroom, all they have to do to be marked ""present"" is to tap a screen and wait to be recognized. However, Cara extends beyond simple attendance taking - with a curious mix of psychology and technology, Cara can recognize the emotions permeating a face. In combination with observing facial angles, Cara makes it possible to tell who's paying attention in class - and how they're feeling about it. Teachers can use this feedback to improve their lessons, as well as watch out for under-performing students.

Industry

Lastly, we decided to tackle a problem in the industry - the slowness of employee clock systems. Swiping a time-card or scanning a tag is boring - facial recognition is cool. With Cara, these systems can be easily replaced to be quick and painless. Times are automatically logged between clock-ins and clock-outs, ensuring the integrity of both employees and managers.",0

"Trust Skin - Initially, our website will use an AI-powered model to provide potential customers with a simple explanation of the ingredients they inputted. The AI-powered model used here has been trained with reliable sources of information. Training and using AI on our website is necessary because skincare ingredients are innovated daily, and updating and tracking each ingredient individually is problematic. Thus, by using AI, the input ingredients can be explained thoroughly and accurately. 
Furthermore, our website will attract potential customers who want to explore and treat their skin radically. Our website will partner with many local dermatologists and clinics specializing in various aspects of skin. After placing their order with questionnaires, customers will be classified, and the AI model will choose the best-fit clinic and dermatologist. There were 4 stages in the process: assigned take-home skin testing, collected sample, analyzing sample, and doctor approval. Besides these services included in the order, the customer can also have further assistance with our AI model skincare ingredient recommendation to maintain their improved skin condition after treatment.",0

"Voker - Voker is a no-code platform that empowers product teams to build AI features in minutes without involving engineers. Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our platform to improve their consumer experience and retention.

Alex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was running Technology & Data. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to $100MM in Revenue.

Alex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.

Voker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features. By making AI accessible and practical, Voker helps these businesses profit from this new wave of innovation. ",1
