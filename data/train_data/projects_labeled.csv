"Good Vibrations - Our device generates signals using CircuitPython to produce specific vibration patterns. This vibration could be noisy and improve sensation and balance via stochastic resonance as described above. We can also control the vibration motors individually to provide more fine-grained information about the userâ€™s environment. For example, the motor array could vibrate more intensely on the left side, indicating an approaching obstacle from that direction. It is easy to see how this device opens the opportunity to study a number of unique research questions with clinical importance.  

More broadly, this device provides a way to potentially increase safety in balance-impaired individuals. Research shows sensory degradation associated with aging, resulting in an increased number of falls in older individuals. Research also suggests that the introduction of auditory or vibratory stochastic resonance can improve sensory detection. Through this, it is hoped that the application of vibratory stimulation can reduce fall risk and balance impairment in these communities. Recurrent elderly fallers are often hospitalized and have much higher mortality rates, hence the importance of developing a non-invasive intervention and research tool, such as ours. This device, in addition to traditional research use, can also be sent home with research participants to see how its regular use alters fall risk.",0

"Cara - Cara is simple - it's a service that offers a drop-in solution for facial authentication. Any app or website can incorporate Cara into their service with ease - all the difficult bits are abstracted away by the robust yet secure technology hiding behind Cara's servers. The idea is to bring the power of this new technology to everyone - from aspiring startups trying to get their products off the ground to freelance developers looking for a way to differentiate themselves from the crowd. In order to prove Cara's widespread applications, we built a series of demos incorporating Cara in different aspects, proving its worth within the family, the education system, and the industry at large.

Family

Dementia and Alzheimer's are terrible to experience - both as the victim and his/her family. Though Cara can't solve major breakthroughs in medical technology, we can help mitigate the memory-related symptoms of these diseases. Cara can be used on AR devices to help patients of dementia or Alzheimer's remember who they're talking to. With the press of a button, Cara will recognize the person in front of you and pull up helpful information about them - such as their name, the last time you've seen them, and where they work. With the power of technology, we can transform the last moments of our elders into memorable experiences rather than painful ones.

Education

""Can anyone tell me who's absent today?"" - a common question repeated across the world every morning in thousands of high school classrooms, Cara can solve this too. Using a simple camera setup in front of every classroom doorway, taking attendance manually becomes a relic of the past. As students filter into the classroom, all they have to do to be marked ""present"" is to tap a screen and wait to be recognized. However, Cara extends beyond simple attendance taking - with a curious mix of psychology and technology, Cara can recognize the emotions permeating a face. In combination with observing facial angles, Cara makes it possible to tell who's paying attention in class - and how they're feeling about it. Teachers can use this feedback to improve their lessons, as well as watch out for under-performing students.

Industry

Lastly, we decided to tackle a problem in the industry - the slowness of employee clock systems. Swiping a time-card or scanning a tag is boring - facial recognition is cool. With Cara, these systems can be easily replaced to be quick and painless. Times are automatically logged between clock-ins and clock-outs, ensuring the integrity of both employees and managers.",0

So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.

We've got two open source projects:
- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).
- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev

Both Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.

"ReactWise - Our Mission: 
We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.


The Problem: 
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).


Our Approach: 
In our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",1

"et al. - et al. is a mobile app that aggregates your newsletters, research papers, articles, and more, in one place. Think of it as an LLM-powered feed delivering you useful content in short insights.

For example, if you’re building an AI voice agent, you’ll see the latest in speech-to-text models without having to actively search, go through a pile of research papers, or prompt an LLM.

We extract key takeaways from long-form content - allowing you to read as little or as much as you like from the original piece of information. With et al., you get to stay on top of breakthroughs in your field, build knowledge, and discover new interests effortlessly.",1

"Bucket Robotics - 250M lbs of plastic is wasted annually in US manufacturing. Bucket Robotics is making defect detection faster and easier to deploy to prevent that.

Our products are designed to be easy to integrate into existing automation and technology stacks, flexible enough to bring retooling costs down, and reliable enough to make you forget that it's a robot.

Matt and Steph are leveraging their experience from the self-driving industry, where we've integrated high-performance computing and quality sensing into complex, noise-filled environments. We focus on robust hardware and user-friendly software for a new generation of end-users, ensuring ease of use and rapid deployment.

Secure and efficient handling of user data can make customers in the manufacturing space nervous to invest in sensing — our team's extensive experience handling self-driving car data in these regulated environments positions us uniquely to tackle these challenges. Companies like Keyence, National Instruments, and FLIR offer either outdated hardware or prohibitively expensive systems, along with software that hasn’t evolved to meet modern user needs.

US manufacturing is undergoing a significant transformation, with construction spending hitting a record annualized pace of over $200 billion. The need for a more reliable supply chain has seen over $700 billion in manufacturing megaprojects across North America since 2021, and this growth requires heavy automation. Bucket Robotics is at the forefront of this shift, offering a scalable, cost-effective solution that enhances automation and positions manufacturers closer to their end customers.",1
"Elayne - Elayne empowers families to build generational wealth by automating estate planning and settlements on a single, unified platform. As the AI Executor, we manage the entire estate transfer process, facilitating $3 trillion in wealth transfers annually, with a ~3% take rate.

Adria experienced this challenge firsthand after her mom passed away, leaving her to settle the estate while balancing her career. The process is currently entirely manual and takes an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Adria eventually burned out and resigned, which is when she realized that bereavement costs businesses $100 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition.

By addressing this problem through businesses, Elayne generates recurring revenue in an industry traditionally reliant on 1x transactions, while maintaining a lasting presence in the end user’s life. We directly alleviate the 43% increase in attrition following the death of a family member, while reducing overall costs for grieving families, democratizing estate support, and saving users hundreds of hours in financial, legal, and administrative tasks per loss.",1

They're live in the US and Mexico, available for download on iOS and Android: https://blaze.money",1
"pap! - Consumers miss out on $70B+ every year because they're busy and unaware, and that money is sitting in their email inbox. So, we automated reading email receipts and claiming the money they're entitled to, offering a service to which you can sign up once, do (literally) nothing, and earn $.

Where is this money coming from?

- Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference
- Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation.
- Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money.
- And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds.

Today, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible.

We started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape.

Why us? (1) We're obsessed with reclaiming what's rightfully yours: Kamal and Anthony grew up in Lebanon, where people's money was unfairly taken away. (2) Weijie was the lead infra engineer for Wish's recommendation system, the feature that fueled their IPO. Our combined experience includes Apple, Addepar, Bolt, Wish, and StackAdapt.

And we're all working towards one goal: move those billions of dollars where they belong.

"Mindely - Mindely is the first AI interviewer designed for skills assessment interviews. Hiring for high volume, high turnover roles (e.g., consultants, analysts, sales & customer representatives) is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to unconscious bias. Managers spend valuable time on lengthy skill-based interviews instead of focusing on building candidate relationships or on driving company revenue. 

Traditional AI interviewers don’t solve these issues – their rigid Q&A formats and one-size-fits-all approach can’t handle complex skill assessments. Mindely changes the game as the first AI interviewer built for in-depth case study, technical and role-play interviews. It: 
- Simulates human interaction with real-time dialogue 
- Challenges candidates with dynamic, adaptive responses 
- Eliminates interviewer bias to create a fair, inclusive hiring process 
- Works 24/7 to free up senior staff and widen talent pool 

With Mindely, companies can rapidly customize and deploy human interviews at AI scale to test specific on-the-job skills.",1
"TradeFlow - TradeFlow is AI-powered settlement for financial securities. During her time in financial services, Taryn saw firsthand how inefficient and costly it is to settle trades.

"Voker - Voker is a no-code platform that empowers product teams to build AI features in minutes without involving engineers. Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our platform to improve their consumer experience and retention.

Alex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was running Technology & Data. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to $100MM in Revenue.

Alex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.

Voker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features. By making AI accessible and practical, Voker helps these businesses profit from this new wave of innovation. ",1

We’re starting in Asia, where QR code digital wallets are taking over and are now the top choice at checkout. As these wallets start to join forces for cross-border payments, Moreta will be the first to bridge the gap for international travelers from card-centric markets to seamlessly tap into these local networks. Moreta will target 67 million travelers arriving in the region each year, who together have $127 billion in everyday expenditure.",1
"HYBRD - HYBRD is Strava for elite athletes who do more than just cardio. It brings all your training data together by integrating with top wearables and uses AI to make tracking weightlifting easy. This allows athletes to fully understand their training load, track holistic progress over time, and compete with friends in fresh, exciting ways.

Existing products tend to focus on only one type of exercise—either cardio or strength—leaving hybrid athletes juggling disconnected tools. As hybrid athletes themselves the founders found this frustrating and set out to build the unified approach they needed for their training.

Three of HYBRD’s founders previously worked at WHOOP, each leading teams across product, growth and analytics. In parallel, Mats was a member of the US national rowing team and Ben, Shoe and Ruiters have all completed Ironman 70.3s. ",1
