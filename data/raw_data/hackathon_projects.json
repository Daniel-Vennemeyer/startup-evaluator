The patients themselves may never have known about the possibility of participating without our site, which increases education and awareness. Many people want to help others, especially groups they are a part of, so being upfront with what types of people these trials are in need of can give the patients an idea of who those trials aim to help. The site consists of four pages: Home, Trials, Organizations, and Legal. Home and Legal are information regarding the site itself; the mission statement, legalities regarding HIPPA, etc. Trials is a grid of cards for each open clinical trial, which links to the organization putting it on so patients can do more accurate and informed research. These profiles then both link back to Trials, as well as link to the Organizations tab which shows a grid of cards for all the organizations on the site, which can all be viewed in more detail on the individual cards. The overarching goal of ClinicalConnections is to bring the clinical trial process into the modern age, with transparency, passion, and reach."

This vibration could be noisy and improve sensation and balance via stochastic resonance as described above. We can also control the vibration motors individually to provide more fine-grained information about the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment. For example, the motor array could vibrate more intensely on the left side, indicating an approaching obstacle from that direction. It is easy to see how this device opens the opportunity to study a number of unique research questions with clinical importance.  \n\nMore broadly, this device provides a way to potentially increase safety in balance-impaired individuals. Research shows sensory degradation associated with aging, resulting in an increased number of falls in older individuals. Research also suggests that the introduction of auditory or vibratory stochastic resonance can improve sensory detection. Through this, it is hoped that the application of vibratory stimulation can reduce fall risk and balance impairment in these communities. Recurrent elderly fallers are often hospitalized and have much higher mortality rates, hence the importance of developing a non-invasive intervention and research tool, such as ours. This device, in addition to traditional research use, can also be sent home with research participants to see how its regular use alters fall risk."

The simulation runs for 2 years, split into 8 financial quarters. In each quarter, the game displays news that pertains to possible market trends, and the player can read these headlines and make decisions whether to buy, sell, or hold their stocks in a certain company. After each quarter, the player receives more news, and the game loop continues until September 1, 2007, whereupon the game ends, giving an ending screen and a summary of what you did with your available funds. Some stocks plummet, some are merely inflation hedges, and some are great investments."

While many people have unlimited texting these days, unlimited data is still nowhere near as common. There are also many places which have too poor of a signal for good data connections but a good enough signal for SMS. Since Dialext is completely SMS-based (from the user's perspective), it eliminates the need for data, which is required for many other web-based or app-based translation and chatting applications! Another bonus is the convenience - not only does Dialext provide a chatting space for you and your friends, but it automatically does all the translations behind the scenes without the user having to copy/paste the texts from their friends into 3rd party translators!"

Any app or website can incorporate Cara into their service with ease - all the difficult bits are abstracted away by the robust yet secure technology hiding behind Cara's servers. The idea is to bring the power of this new technology to everyone - from aspiring startups trying to get their products off the ground to freelance developers looking for a way to differentiate themselves from the crowd. In order to prove Cara's widespread applications, we built a series of demos incorporating Cara in different aspects, proving its worth within the family, the education system, and the industry at large.\n\nFamily\n\nDementia and Alzheimer's are terrible to experience - both as the victim and his/her family. Though Cara can't solve major breakthroughs in medical technology, we can help mitigate the memory-related symptoms of these diseases. Cara can be used on AR devices to help patients of dementia or Alzheimer's remember who they're talking to. With the press of a button, Cara will recognize the person in front of you and pull up helpful information about them - such as their name, the last time you've seen them, and where they work. With the power of technology, we can transform the last moments of our elders into memorable experiences rather than painful ones.\n\nEducation\n\n\"Can anyone tell me who's absent today?\" - a common question repeated across the world every morning in thousands of high school classrooms, Cara can solve this too. Using a simple camera setup in front of every classroom doorway, taking attendance manually becomes a relic of the past. As students filter into the classroom, all they have to do to be marked \"present\" is to tap a screen and wait to be recognized. However, Cara extends beyond simple attendance taking - with a curious mix of psychology and technology, Cara can recognize the emotions permeating a face. In combination with observing facial angles, Cara makes it possible to tell who's paying attention in class - and how they're feeling about it. Teachers can use this feedback to improve their lessons, as well as watch out for under-performing students.\n\nIndustry\n\nLastly, we decided to tackle a problem in the industry - the slowness of employee clock systems. Swiping a time-card or scanning a tag is boring - facial recognition is cool. With Cara, these systems can be easily replaced to be quick and painless. Times are automatically logged between clock-ins and clock-outs, ensuring the integrity of both employees and managers."

Training and using AI on our website is necessary because skincare ingredients are innovated daily, and updating and tracking each ingredient individually is problematic. Thus, by using AI, the input ingredients can be explained thoroughly and accurately. \nFurthermore, our website will attract potential customers who want to explore and treat their skin radically. Our website will partner with many local dermatologists and clinics specializing in various aspects of skin. After placing their order with questionnaires, customers will be classified, and the AI model will choose the best-fit clinic and dermatologist. There were 4 stages in the process: assigned take-home skin testing, collected sample, analyzing sample, and doctor approval. Besides these services included in the order, the customer can also have further assistance with our AI model skincare ingredient recommendation to maintain their improved skin condition after treatment."
